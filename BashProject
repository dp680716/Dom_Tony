# This script is intended to find specific information about the processes running on your computer:
# Amount of CPU time, name, ID and start time for the process and user-owned processes and then generate 
# a report of the data

# Sort the running processes by TIME (length process has been running) or the 7th key: k7

ps -Afc | sort -rk 7

# Write the sorted output to a text file, which I have chosen to name processlogs.txt, to be read from

ps -Afc | sort -rk 7 > processlogs.txt

# Find the corresponding data from the file including: all user-owned processes, and the name, PID, running 
# time and start time of the longest running process

awk '{if(NR==4) print "\nLongest Running Process: \nPID:", $2, "\nSTIME:", $5,"\nRUN TIME: " $7, 
"\nPROCESS NAME: " $8}{if(/501/) print"\nUser-Owned: " $8}' processlogs.txt

# Write that data to a new file named process_log.txt

awk '{if(NR==4) print "\nLongest Running Process: \nPID:", $2, "\nSTIME:", $5,"\nRUN TIME: " $7, 
"\nPROCESS NAME: " $8}{if(/501/) print"\nUser-Owned: " $8}' processlogs.txt > process_log.txt
